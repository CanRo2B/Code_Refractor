# Code_Refractor
First Homework UCF Bootcamp for Code Refractor

# Summary of Work
This homework worked on utilizing semantics to make the CSS more accessible.  It already incorporated the tab feature to go to different links. We added an id to the Search Engine Optimization header so the tab could open at the Search Engine Optimization section.  We added a title to the main picture as well to help it be more accessible.
